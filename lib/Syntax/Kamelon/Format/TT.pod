Syntax::Kamelon::Format::TT 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Syntax::Kamelon::Format::TT> provides is formatting interface to B<Syntax::Kamelon> that provides support for the Template Toolkit. 
You do not have to create an instance of B<TT> yourself. B<Kamelon> will do that for you. It inherits B<Syntax::Kamelon::Format::Base>.
It is flexible in its use. You have the option of letting it take care of all Template Toolkit operations. Or you can just collect the
formatting information after the parsing process and feed this information to your own instance of Template Toolkit.

=head1 OPTIONS

The constructor is called with a paired list of options as parameters. You can use
the following options.

=item B<notoolkit> boolean

If you specify this option B<TT> will not create a Template Toolkit instance. You can pull the formatting data through the B<GetData> method. 
The default setting is 0. If you set this option, all other options become meaningless.

=item B<outmethod> various

This option is passed on to the B<process> method of the Template Toolkit. It can be a reference to a scalar, an output file handle, or

=item B<template> filename

=item B<toolkit> boolean

=item B<ttconfig> boolean
